WeBWorK Install Script

The goal of the ww_install.pl script is to install webwork on any system that has the prerequisites
already installed. It's been lightly tested on

Fedora 17 (11/20/2012)
Ubuntu 12.04 (11/20/2012)

where it did in fact install webwork. If your system does not have all of the prerequisites installed,
then the install_prerequisites.sh script might help.  It will install many of the prerequisites on
Fedora and Ubuntu. We're working on getting it to install prereqs on other systems also.
